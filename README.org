* magit-gh-pulls

  foo
  magit-gh-pulls is a [[https://github.com/magit/magit][Magit]] extension that allows you to conveniently manipulate
  Github's pull requests from Emacs.

** Installation

   magit-gh-pulls is available on [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]]. To install it do the following:

   : M-x package-install RET magit-gh-pulls RET

   Now that the package is installed you have to put the following code to your
   =init.el=:

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'magit-gh-pulls)
(add-hook 'magit-mode-hook 'turn-on-magit-gh-pulls)
   #+END_SRC

** Usage

   In =magit-status= window press =# g g= to refresh the list of pull requests.
   magit-gh-pulls automatically infers credentials from the URL of the
   repository. If there are some PRs available, a new section will appear
   called *Pull Requests*. Each item in this section has the following form:

   : [pull-request-number@branch-name] Pull request name

   Highlighting the desired PR and pressing =# g f= will fetch the commits
   associated with the PR. These are the real commits that you can view, apply,
   cherry-pick etc.

   From this point magit-gh-pulls offers you two options:

   - press =# g b= on the PR to create a topic branch for this PR. After testing
     the PR you can merge it back into your branch using Magit.
   - press =# g m= to merge the PR on top of the currently checked out branch.
     This is convenient if pull request can be merged by fast-forwarding and
     no testing is needed (or you can test from your branch directly). A nice
     benefit of this approach over merging from Github interface is that in
     case of FF no merge commit is produced, so history stays nice and linear.
